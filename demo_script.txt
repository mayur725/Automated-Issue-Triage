Demo Script (2-4 minutes) — Automated Issue Triage & Categorization

Intro (0:00-0:20)
- Quick intro: "Hi, I'm Mohd Kaif Malik. This demo shows an Automated Issue Triage prototype that ingests ServiceNow tickets, classifies them, retrieves relevant Confluence docs and links to resolved JIRA incidents, and suggests priority."

Show architecture (0:20-0:50)
- Briefly show architecture slide: Input (ServiceNow tickets) -> Classifier (LLM) -> Retriever (OpenAI embeddings) -> Output (category, priority, docs, JIRA links). Mention Prometheus metrics and Docker.

Live demo (0:50-2:20)
- Switch to the web UI. Paste a sample ticket: short desc + description.
- Click "Run Triage".
- Show the JSON output: category, priority, confidence, matched_doc, matched_jira, explanation.
- Repeat with 2 more tickets: a performance issue and a config request to show different categories and matched docs/JIRA.

Explain internals briefly (2:20-3:10)
- Explain that embeddings are precomputed for Confluence docs and resolved JIRA summaries, and query embeddings are computed on the fly to find nearest docs.
- Explain fallback behavior (TF-IDF) if OpenAI not configured.

Closing (3:10-3:30)
- Summarize value: reduces manual triage time, routes issues faster, surfaces relevant docs and past incidents.
- Mention next steps: integrate with live ServiceNow/JIRA/Confluence APIs, add access control, and improve ranking.

End (3:30-4:00)
- Thank you + contact info.

Narration tips:
- Speak clearly. Use the lines above as guide; you don't need to read verbatim.
- Keep demo actions quick and pre-run to avoid flakiness.
